# Cat
 Feeling lonely?  Don't worry!  We habe just the solution for you!
 Have a little cat on your taskbar keeping you company as you work.

 It has many animations, such as:
    - Tail Flicking
    - Blinking
    - Ear Twitches
    - Walking
    - Sleeping
    - Head Tilting

 In hidden icons, there is a menu with three options:

 1. TOGGLE VISIBILITY:

        Need a little break from your new digital furry companion but you dont want to leave them alone either?
        Don't worry!  This button allows you to send them away and call them back whenever you need!

 2. RESET:

        Did your cat see something paranormal and is now endlessly staring with such an intense consentration it isn't doing anything else?
        Hit Reset!  Distract that cat from a desktop ghost!
        (This may be needed if you pick it up repeatedly in quick succession)

 3. QUIT:

        Want to say goodbye to your little friend?  No problem!  We have a quit button!

 

 * Your cat friend may clip behind the taskbar after clicking on it, if you want to fix this just click back on your cat right after
